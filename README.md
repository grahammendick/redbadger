# Red Badger Challenge
Here's my solution to the Red Badger 'Martian Robots' challenge.

## Run
There aren't any dependencies so, after you've cloned the code, you can run it straight away:
```
node index.js
```
It's primed with the sample data so this command should log the following output to the console:
```
1 1 E
3 3 N LOST
2 3 S
```
You can change the input data by editing the `input.txt` file

## Test
I've written some unit tests to give you an idea of my approach to testing. They cover some basic scenarios as well as one test for the sample data. You can run the tests with:
```
npm install
npm test 
```
